# Face-recognisation-using-viola-jones
This repository contains a brief description of Viola Jones Algorithm For Face detection. The project was done for the purpose of learning.

### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python3 which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

##### pip install requirements.txt
